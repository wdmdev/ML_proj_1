#Project 1 from introduction to machine learning and data mining

This project is from my third semester of the BSc Eng. in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at The Technical University of Denmark.

Data used for the project comes from the openly available website http://noegletal.dk provided by the ministry of social affairs and the interior

The project focus was on descriptive and explorative data analysis and data preprocessing. It includes:

1. Descritions of the features in the dataset
2. Preprocessing of the dataset like standardizing and normalizing data
3. An investigation of variance in the data through Principal Component Analysis
